# Arvato Test Challenge
This repository contains the code for the automation test task (Acceptance tests using Gherkin & Specflow).

## Getting started
Open the solution on visual studio 2019 and make sure that the CurrencyApi.Specs project is set as the main project.

Note: If the api key has expired (See `ApiService.cs` file, line 12), then you need to go to https://fastforex.io to acquire a new api key for the tests to work.


## Execute tests
Using Visual Studio 2019, select Test -> Run All Tests to start executing the Specflow test suite.
